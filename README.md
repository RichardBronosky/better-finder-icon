better-finder-icon
==================

A slight adjustment to the Finder icon for Apple's Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10

If you want to do this yourself, just apply a Hue/Saturation adjustment to the 2 default PNG files. I used Hue: +8 Saturation: -30 Lightness: -19 That makes the bottom left corner of the new icon match the same corner on the old icon. See the results below.
