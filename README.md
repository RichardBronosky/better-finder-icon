better-finder-icon
==================

A slight adjustment to the Finder icon for Apple's Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10

To install, use the ![Download ZIP](http://i.imgur.com/rfJY11a.png) button. Expand the zip in your ~/Downloads folder. The [replace_finder_icons.sh](https://github.com/RichardBronosky/better-finder-icon/blob/master/replace_finder_icons.sh) script expects to find a better-finder-icon-master directory which is the result of downloading that zip file and opening it in the default location.

To uninstall, use the [restore_finder_icons.sh](https://github.com/RichardBronosky/better-finder-icon/blob/master/restore_finder_icons.sh) script.

If you want to do this yourself, just apply a Hue/Saturation adjustment to the 2 default PNG files. I used Hue: +8 Saturation: -30 Lightness: -19 That makes the bottom left corner of the new icon match the same corner on the old icon. See the results below.
